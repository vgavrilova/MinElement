# MinElement

Hey everyone!

I continue working with the arrays in Java. And this is a small application that can return the miinimun value of all the numbers
the user has entered.<br>
The program reads the user input. Firstly, it asks how many numbers s/he would like to enter. Secondly, it reads the
numbers from a console and saves them to an array. Eventually, all of the values in the array are compared with each other
and then the min value is returned.<br>
For further functionality see the comments in my code.


Have fun!
